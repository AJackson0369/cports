# cports

Cports is a collection of source package ports for Chimera. The system has been
written specifically for the distribution using the Python scripting language.

Originally started as a rewrite of `xbps-src` from Void Linux, it has since
transitioned to the `apk` packaging system (of Alpine Linux).

Currently it is still very much work in progress.

## TODO

Right now it is very limited. It is capable of creating packages, as well as
bootstrapping itself from source.

* Cross-compiling
* Clean, bootstrap update, etc.
* Rebase on Clang
* ...
