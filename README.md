# cports

Cports is a collection of source package ports for Chimera. The system has been
written specifically for the distribution using the Python scripting language.

**Right now, the system is not considered stable.** There will likely be major
changes and refactorings. Contributions are, however, still welcome.

The system is largely inspired by `xbps-src` from Void Linux, but should not be
considered a variant of it, nor it should be expected that the options and
behaviors are the same.

There are two authoritative documents on the system:

* `Manual.md` is the reference manual for packagers. It covers the API of the
  system and guidelines for creating and modifying templates, but not usage.
* `Usage.md` is the reference for users. It covers all the options of the
  `cbuild` system itself.

Most people looking to get involved with the project should read both.

To get started, read `Usage.md` first.
