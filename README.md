# cports

Cports is a collection of source package ports for Chimera. It was originally
created as a rewrite of `xbps-src` from Void Linux in Python. Currently it is
still somewhat messy, and still uses xbps.

## TODO

Right now it is very limited. It is capable of creating packages, as well as
bootstrapping itself from source.

* Cross-compiling
* Clean, bootstrap update, etc.
* Rebase on Clang
* Move away from xbps
* ...
