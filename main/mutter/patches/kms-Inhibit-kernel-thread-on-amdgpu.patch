Subject: kms: Inhibit kernel thread on amdgpu

Recent AMD Ryzen systems are experiencing a problem whereby gnome-shell
gets SIGKILLed by the kernel. It seems to be related to a violation of
RLIMIT_RTTIME in the KMS thread.

This is the simplest/safest workaround we have right now. Longer term
we would like to:

1. Find out what call is blocking in amdgpu to trigger it; and
2. Graceful handling of SIGXCPU before SIGKILL happens.
