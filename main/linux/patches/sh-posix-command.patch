Subject: [PATCH] remove CC check

The CC variable is allowed to contain arguments, but the way it
is checked here does not guarantee that. The FreeBSD shell is
POSIX compliant here - the command builtin is not expected to
take any additional arguments when used with -v. That breaks the
check when CC actually contains them. As we control the build
environment and there doesn't seem to be a simple way to split
off just the command part, just remove the check.
